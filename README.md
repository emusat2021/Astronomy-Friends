## Features

#### Navbar
- Navbar at the top - helping user to easily navigate to diferent sections.
#### Back to the top
- Back to the top button/arrow visible on the right bottom-side of the page.
#### Collapsed divs
- In the *Beginner's guide* section there are three collapsed divs with a *Read more* button. When the user presses the *Read more* button, the div expands, presenting some information about the specific subject. Also, with the help of Javascript, the text on the button changes to *Read less*. When the user presses the *Read Less* button, the divs collapses back and hides the information.
#### Images
Images about Astronomy which bring more ease to understand the presented subject.
#### APIs
There are multiple APIs used in this website:
- <a href="https://satellites.fly.dev/" target="_blank">Satellite Passes API</a> (used to predict when a satellite will pass above a specific location)
- <a href="https://www.emailjs.com/" target="_blank">EmailJS</a> (used to send feedback via email)
- <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> (used to choose a specific location on the map)
#### Google Maps
The website uses Google Maps to facilitate the user in choosing a location in order to observe an object.
#### Forms
- The first form used in the page is located in the *Satellites Tracker* section. The form is used to gather necessary data in order to identify and locate an object in orbit. It has three input boxes: Name/ID, Latitude, Longitude as well as three buttons: View, Reset, Get my location. View is used to submit the form, Reset is used to reset the form while Get my location is used to draw a Marker on the map at the location of the user.
- The second form is located in the *Contact* section and it is used to get feddback from the user. There is an EmailJS API attached to the form which makes possible to send a user's message to the owner of the site.
- Form2 from Contact section has two modals: id #contactModalSuccess and id #contactModalError.
  The #contactModalSuccess modal is displayed when the message is send successfully. After the modal is dismissed, the form2 is cleared.
  The #contactModalError modal is displayed when the message fails to send.

#### Favorite Objects
In the *Satellites Tracker* section there is a list with three favorite objects: the International Space Station (ISS), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Tianhe. When the user clicks on a favorite object, the name of the respective object is automatically copied in the Name-ID input textbox.
#### Database with objects
Using a file located <a href="https://tle.info/data/ALL_TLE.ZIP">here</a> it was possible to extract a list with tens of thousands of object names with their corresponding Norad ID. The list is in the ```data.js``` file.
#### Autocomplete list
In order to ease the search for a specific object an autocomplete list was implemented using code located <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_autocomplete.asp">here</a>. When the user starts typing in the Name/ID input box, the autocomplete script suggests a list of maximum 30 names from the database.
#### Favicon 
- A favorite icon has been implemented so that a user can recognize the logo on the browser tab.
#### Footer
The footer is styled using Bootstrap. It contains links to social media as well as a disclaimer and a copyright note.
#### Single page HTML
the site is constructed using a single page HTML with sections. The following sections are available:
- About
- Beginner's guide
- Satellites Tracker
- Contact

### Features Left to Implement
* Add more information about Astronomy, tools used
* Use cookies to improve user experience (chosen objects can be saved in cookies and shown as history)

        1. The user starts typing an object name in the Name/ID input textbox and the suggestion list appears. The user chooses the desired object name from the list which is then copied to the Name/ID field. It clicks on View and the Satellite Passes API returns a valid response.
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to send further advice to be able to contact Astronomy Friends.
        1. We did the same tests as in the *As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation to be able to get answers to any questions I may have.* UX
    4. As a Returning Visitor, I want to access the website from any device to be able to use the website anytime and anywhere.
        1. The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
        1. The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.


### Further Testing
- A feature used when testing is the use of a global variable MAIN_DEBUG in Javascript. If it is true then some debug messages are logged to console. The variable is set to false by default.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

- Browsers on mobile phones cannot parse Date strings correctly.
Countdown is not working on mobile (see the image below) because the date string is not parsed and thus startPassMsec and endPassMsec variables from main.js -> function(firstResponse) become NaN.
Therefore, the countdown value cannot be calculated.

Test image desktop

![Test image desktop](assets/images/readme/desktop-countdown-test.jpg).

Test image mobile

![Test image mobile](assets/images/readme/mobile-countdown-test.jpg).

Solution to this bug:

Use new Date() object instead of Date.parse().
Idea taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5324178/javascript-date-parsing-on-iphone.

- Google Chrome browser disables location services if the protocol is HTTP
When someone develops the application, if the web server is running HTTP only, then location services are automatically disabled by the browser. The solution is to use a HTTPS server. The gitpod.io environment is running an HTTPS server.

This is how the data looks in the ALL_TLE.TXT file:
```
VANGUARD 1
1     5U 58002B   21138.49553650 -.00000158  00000-0 -17345-3 0  9991

```
This is how the data looks in ```data.js```:
```
"VANGUARD 1 [5]"
```
The name of the object is obtained from row 1.<br>
The Norad ID is obtained from row 3, 2nd column.
